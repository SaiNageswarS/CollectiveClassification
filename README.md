# CollectiveClassification

Based on my paper 
Extended discriminative random walk: a hypergraph approach to multi-view multi-relational transductive learning.

This repo includes source code of Multi-view Multi-relational transductive learnin, datasets and
code used for experimental setup.

## Source Documentation

1. HypergraphDRandomWalk.m is the entry point for algorithm
2. All source prefixed with test* is used to set up test for a particular dataset.
3. HypergraphMRCC.m is source for an earlier approach developed by us to classify dataset with multiple relations and views.
